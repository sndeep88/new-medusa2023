      <p>
        WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AT OUR WEBSITE AND HOW IS IT
        USED?
      </p>
      <p>1. Information Collected Directly From You Through This Website</p>
      <p>
        We collect personal information directly from you to do all the things
        typically associated with e-commerce websites. Examples of the
        information we collect include name, address, telephone number, age,
        size, gender, interests, personal preferences, demographical
        information, email address, credit card number, and purchase
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        This information is collected at various places: for instance, when you
        open an account on the Website; check out with your online order;
        subscribe to catalogs, email offers, and mobile messaging offers;
        participate in surveys, contests, or sweepstakes; interact with us
        through special events (apply for a job, communicate with Customer
        Service or respond to program offers); partake in forums, bulletin
        boards or other online means for posting your comments, feedback,
        images, or content on the Website; or browse through contents of the
        Website. We may combine all of this with information about you that we
        acquire from our joint marketing partners and from other unrelated third
        parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also collect information about those you know—when you provide it to
        us. For example, we collect your gift recipient&apos;s contact information to
        process your gift orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use this information to personalize your online experience at our
        Website: process your online orders (including sending emails to confirm
        your order status and shipment date); communicate with you about our
        products, services, contests, and promotions (unless you have directed
        us not to contact you with promotional communications); improve our
        products and services; analyze trends and statistics; protect the
        security or integrity of our website and our business; personalize your
        online experience with contents and offers that are tailored to your
        interests; notify you regarding surveys and contests; enable you to post
        information on our Website; facilitate online social activity centered
        around our products and services; or enable you to interact with
        third-party content service providers either by linking to their sites,
        viewing their content within our Web environment, or by viewing our
        content within their Web environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you e-mail a wish list to a friend, we will not retain the names or
        e-mail addresses of the recipient of your wish list.
      </p>
      <p>
        You always have the choice not to receive marketing information or
        calls. You will find instructions on opting out in our newsletters and
        on your online profile.
      </p>
      <p>2. Technical Information Collected</p>
      <p>A. Navigational Information</p>
      <p>
        When you visit this Website, we collect navigational information, such
        as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP
        address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you
        navigate.
      </p>
      <p>B. Cookies and Related Technology</p>
      <p>
        To better understand what you do while using our Website, we use a
        browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that is
        stored by your web browser on your computer. It is used to do things
        like see how you navigate our Website, and remember you and your online
        purchases when you return. This helps us improve our site, provide
        better customer service, personalize your online experience, and
        personalize offers to you based on your unique tastes and purchase
        history.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also use pixel tags (also known as clear gifs or web beacons) on our
        Website and in our emails. A pixel tag is an embedded graphic image on a
        web page, web-based document or e-mail message. The pixel tag is used to
        collect information about your visit, including the pages you view,
        which website you came from, the features you use, the links you click,
        and other actions you take in connection with the sites. Pixel tags in
        e-mails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails,
        including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help
        deliver a more personalized online experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This technology allows us to associate your online navigational or
        transactional information with any personal information you provide
        (such as name, address, phone number, and email address). As an example,
        we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag.
        That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in
        mid-purchase and results in an abandoned cart. We can also use this
        technology to determine whether you would be interested in participating
        in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more
        personalized experience that&apos;s tailored to your needs and tastes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can disable or delete cookies by changing your browser settings.
        However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our
        essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For
        instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be
        able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any
        of our products and services that require you to sign in.
      </p>
      <p>3. Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology</p>
      <p>
        Third-party service providers help us analyze our visitor&apos;s site and
        purchase preferences, and may help us deliver ads to you about our
        products through banner ads when you visit other websites (often
        referred to as &quot;online network advertising&quot;). The following provides
        more information about these service providers and the choices you have
        with respect to their services.
      </p>
      <p>A. Analysis</p>
      <p>
        We contract with analytics companies to better understand your use of
        our Websites, and web capabilities like embeddable widgets. They
        accomplish this by using some or all of the technologies described in
        Section 2 above (Technical Information Collected—Cookies and Related
        Technology).
      </p>
      <p>B. Advertising</p>
      <p>
        We contract with third-party advertising companies that, in turn,
        collect non-personally identifying information by placing cookies on
        your browser when you visit our site. These companies may use
        information (not including your name, address, credit card information,
        e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visit to deliver our ads
        on this and other websites through their online advertising networks.
        These companies also provide this information to us which we, in turn,
        use to gauge how effective our ads are.
